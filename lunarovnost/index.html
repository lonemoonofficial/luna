<h2>Dearest Rovnost,</h2>

<h2>I appreciate your letter. Very much. It’s been a while since I’ve had human… interaction..?</h2>

<h2>What is your name? Mine is.. “Luna”, I think...</h2>

<h2>I don’t know if I’m human anymore.</h2>

<h2>Here where I am at the moment, I can’t speak. The only sounds I can make are in my head and in yours by writing this letter. I would speak to you if I could vocalize my own cries.</h2>

<h2>So in turn of that… I’ve been writing a lot. A whole lot.. Just a bunch of thoughts. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I feel like something else is taking over, you know. So if I die, I hope you realize this… That...</h2>

<h2>The doctor keeps watching me. That’s all I know to call him… He’s just lurking in the shadows. Always watching, always watching, always watching…</h2>

<h2>And the person inside me is taking over a little piece of me day by day.</h2>

<h2>It hurts.</h2>

<h2>You are my dearest, you know.</h2>

<h2>I’ve lost track of time. I don’t know how a day works or how time works in general… I don’t know anything anymore. Not even myself. I’ve woken up in different places after falling asleep by pure exhaustion. I don’t know why I haven’t felt hungry at all.. There is a river here, that has some water that I can bathe in and drink, but I feel like that’s half the reason why I’m turning into something I don’t know about.</h2>

<h2>Please help me whenever you find the time.</h2>

<h2>I don’t understand love… But I do feel something similar toward you, and it is strong as my passion to leave this place is.</h2>

<h2>I miss the world and I miss you.</h2>

<h2>Someday I hope I can leave this place and see you again.</h2>

<h2>All my best,</h2>

<h2>~ Luna ☾</h2>
