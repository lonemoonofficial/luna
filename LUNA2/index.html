<h2>Hi… I hope this is working.</h2>

<h2>If anyone can hear me, please let me know. This is the only way I could know that someone out there can hear me.</h2>

<h2>The real reason why I’m writing these is because I don’t know where else to go. I’ve been everywhere, but it doesn’t help when there’s nobody around.</h2>

<h2>Not a single soul. I’m the only one out here.</h2>

<h2>Me, myself, and I.</h2>

<h2>And my favorite scarf.</h2>

<h2>I don’t think I can sleep tonight.</h2>

<h2>I’m too scared of fading away into the night, and nobody ever finding me.</h2>

<h2>I don’t think my head’s wrapped around the fact there is absolutely nobody here.</h2>

<h2>But if you can hear me…</h2>

<h2>If you can truly hear me….</h2>

<h2>My name is Luna. Can you find me?</h2>
