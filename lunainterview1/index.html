<h2></h2>
<h2>[At the beginning of the interview, the subject’s eyes were closed.]</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: I’m going to ask you a few questions. Do you think you can answer them for me?</h2>
<h2>Luna: (slowly nods)</h2>
<h2>Dr ████: All right.</h2>
<h2>[Dr. ████ organizes his papers. When he looks back at Subject Luna, her eyes are open. No irises, pupils, or whites are seen, but a blank space and what seems to be a duplicate of the milky way galaxy is present in each eye.]</h2>
<h2>[Dr. ████ is surprised and flinches.]</h2>
<h2>Dr ████: Okay. Do you know who you are?</h2>
<h2>Luna: [Indeterminate.]</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: Can you speak up for me?</h2>
<h2>Luna: [Barely determinate.] I am in this room.</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: I know where you are. Do you know your name?</h2>
<h2>Luna: [Clearly.] Her name isn’t to be spoken.</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: Alright… Next question.</h2>
<h2>[The lights flicker. Dr. ████ pauses.]</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: Did you do that?</h2>
<h2>[Luna is silent, looks up and back down at Dr. ████.]</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: Luna, did you do that?</h2>
<h2>[The lights dim.]</h2>
<h2>Luna [Standing up.]: Do not use her name.</h2>
<h2>[As Luna speaks, the lights flicker and a few blow out, shattering the bulb. Dr. ████ shields his face. Luna sits down and the lights cease malfunctioning.]</h2>
<h2>Dr ████: [Stuttering and afraid, trying to keep a stoic demeanor.] Why don’t you want me to use your name?</h2>
<h2>Luna: Why didn’t you find her before she was turned to this? Why couldn’t you help her before she died?</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: You are not dead, L- [He pauses, trying not to use her name.] You are not dead. You are here in this room, like you said.</h2>
<h2>Luna: I am here in this room, and she is not.</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: Who are you?</h2>
<h2>Luna: [Indeterminate reverse speak].</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: I said, who are you?</h2>
<h2>Luna: [Very loud indeterminate reverse speak].</h2>
<h2>Supervisor # 404: I think we need to stop. She’s getting angry.</h2>
<h2>Dr. ████: [Talking quietly Mr. Gregory ████] We’re actually getting somewhere this time, we just need to —</h2>
<h2>Supervisor #404: No, I don’t think you need to continue. We need to st-</h2>
<h2>[At this time, the Subject raised her left arm toward Dr. ████ and her left toward Supervisor #404. Both were rendered into dust-like particles of a violet and white color, disintegrated. The recording advisor quickly administered sedation chemicals into the room, calming the Subject down. He then pressed the emergency lock and rushed to the saferoom.]</h2>
